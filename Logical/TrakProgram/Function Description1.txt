This is a sample trak project for the purposes of testing out the snapshot feature.#

Function:                                                                          #
50 shuttles move around the trak to move a product from station to station. This   #
continues until the product is finished and unloaded or rejected and removed.      #
                                                                                   #

The product can exist in four different states. At each stage, the product becomes #
harder/firmer and can be moved faster and accelerated quicker. The four stages and #
their respective parameters are:                                                   #

appropriate reject stations.                                                       #
